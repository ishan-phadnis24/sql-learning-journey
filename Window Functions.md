**Question 3 : Based on the product price, what are the top 5 costliest product types within the 'Home & Furniture' category?**

Approach 1 - 
<img width="1064" height="332" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4c9d6d81-33ea-480e-b56e-9aa1dc103ff1" />

### Limitations
- Returns the top 5 rows instead of the top 5 ranked product types.
- Duplicate product types may appear in the result.
- Ties in price are not handled explicitly.
- Less flexible than window functions for ranking and top-N analysis.

Approach 2 -

**Question: Display each customer’s customer_id,order_id, amount, and their cumulative spending up to that order.**

**Question 4 : Calculate the cumulative amount spent by each customer as orders are placed. **

**Question 5 : For each order, show the customer’s total spending and the running total of spending in order of order_date**

**Question 6 : Display the moving sum of order amounts for each customer, with a window size of N=3, ordered by their order dates.**
**WINDOW OF SIZE 3:**

**1. ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW**

**2. ROWS BETWEEN CURRENT ROW AND 2 FOLLOWING**

**3. ROWS BETWEEN 1 PRECEDING AND 1 FOLLOWING**

**Question 7 :Calculate the cumulative sales amount where all transactions with the same sale amount should be treated together when
computing the running total.**
```sql
SELECT order_id,
amount,
SUM(amount) OVER( ORDER BY amount RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW ) as running_sum
FROM `flipkart.orders`;
```
